# Navbar Fix - Active State Correction

## Issue Identified:
- Vagas link had incorrect active state logic: `location.pathname === '/'` instead of `location.pathname === '/vagas'`
- Início link was missing proper active state logic

## Steps Completed:
1. [x] Fixed Vagas link active class logic (changed to check for '/vagas')
2. [x] Added proper active class logic to Início link (check for '/')
3. [ ] Update sidebar links with proper active state logic (optional enhancement)

## Files Modified:
- frontend/src/Components/NavBar/navbar.jsx

## Testing:
- Verify Início link is active on '/' route
- Verify Vagas link is active on '/vagas' route
- Test both desktop and mobile navigation
